####### INSTALLING #######
For the overly paranoid's like me I reccomend you install this software on a clean VM
running Ubuntu 12.04 and not your primary baitin-station.  It should work either way, just
understand the installer will download a number of required libraries and make several 
configuration changes to your systems DHCP, routing tables and interfaces etc.

0. sudo -i (login as root)
1. apt-get install ruby1.9.3 git
2. gem install colorize
3. git clone https://github.com/PuNk1nPo0p/lootbooty.git
4. cd lootbooty
5. ./sysprep.rb
6. Select option 1 (watch the apt-get screen, it will require a "y" to continue
7. Once the install has completed select option 3 to exit sysprep
8. ./lo0tbo0ty.rb
